# ComfyUI VENV Preparation Tool
Venv preparation tool for ComfyUI which will create its own launch.bat and a shortcut.lnk to it that you can move wherever you want.
You should git clone this tool side by side with your git-cloned ComfyUI. I haven't tested it with portable but you would have to use the new launcher instead of the old one in order to properly venv it.
